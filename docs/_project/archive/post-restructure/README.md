- `docs/syntax.md` - Consolidated syntax reference
- `docs/examples.md` - Pattern-based examples
- `docs/conventions.md` - Essential patterns
- `docs/waymarks-in-documentation.md` - Documentation integration

The archived files are preserved for historical reference and may contain additional details not included in the consolidated versions.
