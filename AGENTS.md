## Waymark Syntax

This project uses **waymarks** for code annotation. A guide on how to use waymarks to annotate code, and how to search with them is in the [Waymark Usage Guide for Agents](.agents/partials/waymark-usage.md).

Please refer to that document for all rules regarding reading, writing, and searching for waymarks. It is the single source of truth.
